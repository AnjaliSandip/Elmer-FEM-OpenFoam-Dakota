This program, Elmer FEM-OpenFoam-Dakota interface, is released under license GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007.

A program for 3 way coupling between open-source software Elmer FEM, OpenFoam and Dakota has been developed. Furthermore, it was succesfully applied to benchmarks. The program along with examples have been provided.

Capabilities:
The interface developed provides an open-source framework that integrates data analytics, finite element and finite volume methods. This framework enables a richer understanding of multi-physics/phase predictions in a time sensitive manner. Its key features include uncertainty quantification, surrogate modeling, parallel programming and robust post-processing capabilities.
