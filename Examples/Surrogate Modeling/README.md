The UQ study was extended to surrogate modeling.
Design and analysis of computer experiments (DACE) technique was employed to generate the training data, a sample size of 20 was chosen.  
A linear regression fit was applied to the training data to construct the global surrogate model.  
Latin hypercube sampling study, with a sample size of 100, was then performed on the global surrogate model.  
The DACE technique was shown to reduce the total run time by 45%.
